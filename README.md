##### Author: Nicholas Bira, updated October 26th, 2020.

1) Have a current installation of the Arduino IDE [LINK](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software).
2) Download the relevant script, specifically EnableInterrupt_Mousewheels.ino, from the MaudeDavidLab GitHub repository.
3) Install the [EnableInterrupt](https://github.com/GreyGnome/EnableInterrupt) Library, required to enable the interrupt function on all pins of an Arduino or other microcontrollers.
4) Connect the relevant Arduino or microcontroller and upload the program, following standard procedure as documented on either the Arduino website or in the documentation of whichever microcontroller is being used.
